# Feature-Detection-Selection-and-Classification
Feature selection refers to the process of reducing the inputs for processing and analysis, or of finding the most meaningful inputs when developing a predictive model. Each feature, or column, represents a measurable piece of data that can be used for analysis like Name, Age, Sex, Fare, and so on. Features are also sometimes referred to as “variables” or “attributes.” Depending on what you're trying to analyze, the features you include in your dataset can vary widely.  Here we will have to make use of the available features from the given data, and Build a Machine Learning Model through many different classifiers with Python Programming to calculate the Accuracy of the Outcome developed by the given data.  Here we have used a dataset related to Diabetes Measures on which we will be performing the task of feature selection.  This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.  The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
